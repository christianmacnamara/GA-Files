# Introduction to Ruby on Rails
#
# HW 01
#
# Purpose:
#
# Read the taks below and complete the exercises in this file. We will start
# to write the beginnings of our "Secret Number Game" using what we've
# learned in Ruby Lesson 01.
#
###############################################################################
#
# 1. Read an Interview with the Creator of Ruby
# 	 http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html
#
# 2. Read this Introduction to Programming
# 	 http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Programming/About_Programming
#
# 3. In this file under "Student Solution," print the welcome text of your Secret 
#    Number Game
#
#	(i.e.) "Welcome to the Secret Number Game!"
#
# 4. Above your welcome message, write a comment to other coders introducing yourself.
#	 .
#
#
# 5. Create two new variables, one for your last name, one for your first name
#    and enter your first and last name as strings.
#
#    first_name = ""
#    last_name = ""
#
# 6. Print to the screen that your game was created by you by concating the
#    first and last name variables.
#
#    (i.e.) "Created by " + first_name + " " + last_name
#
# 7. Feel free to add more lines of text or add comments to remind you of what
#    you've learned.

puts "Hi everyone! My name is Chistian MacNamara. 
I live in Brooklyn and work in midtown at a consulting firm. I'm excited to learn how to work in Ruby"

puts "Welcome to the Secret Number Game!"

first_name = "Christian"
last_name = "MacNamara"

puts "Created by " + first_name + " " + last_name


# puts "Type in any of the key terms below to see their definition"
# puts "String, Method, To methods, Array, Variable"

# string = "A string is a set of characters the computer can process."
# method = "Methods are actions that act upon strings. They are called by placing a '.' in front of the method text"
# To methods = "Some methods only work on certain types of things. But you can 
# always convert between different types using Ruby's 'to' methods. To apply a 'To' method, write To_(abbreviation of method)"
# Array = "Arrays are lists. Lists store things in order"
# Variable = "Variables save a thing and give it a name. You use the equals sign to do this."
